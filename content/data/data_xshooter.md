## Overview

This [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1glfUBEZImT_DEb_7XIjrGxBvrshFsppN?usp=sharing) contains the systems reduced by Alejandra and me. I will upload them periodically until the full collection is completed. Since the reduced data is still private, you can contact [Me](mailto:felipe.avilav@postgrado.uv.cl) or [Alejandra](mailto:amelo@mpa-garching.mpg.de) to request the password to unzip the files. Once the data is published, the files will be made publicly accessible.
